 # 👁️ Eyes on YOLOverse  
*A Deep Dive into the Evolution of YOLO Object Detection — From YOLOv1 to YOLOv9*

---

## 📌 Overview

**Eyes on YOLOverse** is a hands-on, version-by-version exploration of the powerful **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection models — from the original YOLOv1 to the state-of-the-art YOLOv9.

This repository serves as both a **learning journal** and a **performance comparison** hub, documenting how YOLO has evolved over time in architecture, speed, accuracy, and deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Implement and train all major YOLO versions (v1 to v9)
- 📈 Compare real-time performance (FPS), accuracy (mAP), and inference speed
- 🔍 Analyze architectural improvements and changes
- 🧠 Build a learning log and resource for others exploring YOLO
- 💼 Showcase a serious project for portfolio, GitHub, or interviews
